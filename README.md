# IMAGES
Powder dispensing valve is a combination of a servo opening and closing valve with a vibration motor 
The valve kicks into action when it receives the signal from the control board, once it gets instructions form the microcontroller the servo opens the closed valve door to 180 degree which in turns allows the powder to pour out , then the vibration motor receives the signal to start and it starts to vibrate which in turns agitate the powder and reducing the friction between the particles allowing it to pour out easily . Once the desired quantity is achieved the servo gets instructions to close the valve , it then close the opening by moving the door to the zero position followed by this, the vibration motor shuts down hence stopping the dispensing
